## 🧑‍💻 About

Senior iOS Developer with 8+ years of experience, including technical leadership, large-scale feature development, architecture, and product work.  
Worked in international startups and mature products with DAU 1M+.  
I manage the entire mobile development cycle — from discovery to App Store release.  
Within the team, I take on more than just coding: I shape processes, mentor teammates, and suggest product hypotheses and success metrics.
